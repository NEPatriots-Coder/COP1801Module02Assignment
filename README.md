# JavaScript Variable and Area Calculation Example

This project demonstrates basic JavaScript variable declaration, initialization, and simple calculations. The program performs the following tasks:

1. **Prompt for First Name:**
    - Asks the user for their first name and stores it in a variable `Fname`.
    - Displays a welcome message that includes the user's name.

2. **Constant for Pi:**
    - Defines a constant `piValue` to store the value of Pi to 7 significant digits (3.1415926).

3. **Prompt for Favorite Number:**
    - Asks the user to input their favorite number and stores the value in a variable `myFavNum`.

4. **Calculate Area of Circle:**
    - Calculates the area of a circle using the user's favorite number as the radius.
    - Stores the result in a variable `myArea`.
    - The formula to find the area of a circle is \( A = \pi r^2 \).

5. **Display Results:**
    - Displays the contents of each variable on the webpage with a descriptive message.
